1. Incident commander name:
Martin Book

2. Executive Summary of what happened:
Somebody launched three new pods in default namespace as you can see in this list:
default         cryptotonight                                                     1/1     Running            1          3h4m
default         minergate                                                         0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          3h4m*
default         moneropool                                                        1/1     Running            0          3h4m
default         stress-demo-54b568b584-8dqtv                                      1/1     Running            0          151m

* Image is no more available. I deployed  "image: progrium/stress" instead to demo increased workload
We were able to detect them quickly

3. Summary of what was affected:
It seems like the attack was only partial successfull.
I saw increased workload in the default namespace (AttackDashboard2025-04-24 15-32-09.png) 
and alerts in Falco Dashboard:
Warning Sensitive file opened for reading by non-trusted program (file=/etc/shadow gparent=systemd ggparent=<NA> gggparent=<NA> evt_type=open user=root user_uid=0 user_loginuid=-1 process=cat proc_exepath=/bin/cat parent=containerd-shim command=cat /etc/shadow terminal=34816 container_id=983892a322b7 container_name=k8s_stress_stress-demo-54b568b584-8dqtv_default_487ae8ad-3f69-410a-9243-b4cde2e21137_0)

4. Summmry of the impact:
Someone was able to create new pods and tried to get sensitive data. 
The attacker attempted to steal usernames and hashed passwords 

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
The admin has discovered the suspicious activities with our Grafana dashboards. Therefore we were able to detect the attack quickly and to delete the pods.

6. Summary of lessons learned:
We should check the Kubernetes API server access, check our security concept to find out how the attacker got access.
I will immediatly generate new access keys to prevent further attacks
