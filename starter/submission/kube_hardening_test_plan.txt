Write at least 200 words describing a Kubernetes-specific test plan based on what you learned from the course. The test plan does not need to address specific hardening steps. Answer these two questions in your test plan:
1) How will you test the changes?
We will change and test the config on dev cluster 
After this we can rollout to preprod cluster. Here we mimics of production services and can examine if there is any impact on directly and indirectly involved services.
2) How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster?
- We will monitor metrics with prometheus and our Grafana observability dashboard and check for any negative impact like increased latency, alarms or missing data.
- We will also do some basic function tests with our microservices in preprod to examine that all processes still work correctly
- We will apply a basic load test to check if there is any impact when increasing the load.
3) Documentation and Rollback
We will also setup a git project and a new branch for the security changes. This enables us to persist config especially cluster.yml before changes.
All changes and config steps should be documented and we will create screenshots of security tests (kube-bench and docker-bench) before and after config changes
In case of negative impacts we van do a quick rollback to previous configuration.
4) Prod Rollout Recommendation: After preprod observation for at least 5 working days we could create a ticket for a change on prod system and plan final rollout.
